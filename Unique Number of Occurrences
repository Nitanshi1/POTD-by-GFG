Unique Number of Occurrences
13th July,2023
Given an array arr of N integers, the task is to check whether the frequency of the elements in the array is unique or not. Or in other words, there are no two distinct numbers in array with equal frequency. If all the frequency is unique then return true, else return false.

//Example 1:

//Input:
N = 5
arr = [1, 1, 2, 5, 5]

//Output:
false

//Explanation:
The array contains 2 (1’s), 1 (2’s) and 2 (5’s), since the number of frequency of 1 and 5 are the same i.e. 2 times. Therefore, this array does not satisfy the conditi

SOLUTION:-
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def isFrequencyUnique(self, n : int, arr : List[int]) -> bool:
        # code here
        dic = {}
        ans = []
        for i in arr:
            if i in dic:
                dic[i]+=1
            else:
                dic[i]=1
        for i in dic:
            if dic[i] not in ans:
                ans.append(dic[i])
            else:
                return False
        return True
