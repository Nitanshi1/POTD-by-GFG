Non-Repeating Character

Given a string S consisting of lowercase Latin Letters. Return the first non-repeating character in S. If there is no non-repeating character, return '$'.

Example 1:

Input:
S = hello
Output: h
Explanation: In the given string, the
first character which is non-repeating
is h, as it appears first and there is
no other 'h' in the string.

SOLUTION:-
class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to find the first non-repeating character in a string.
    char nonrepeatingCharacter(string S)
    {
       //Your code here
        {
       unordered_map<char,int> mp;
       
       for(int i=0;i<S.length();i++)
       {
           mp[S[i]]++;
       }
       
       
       for(auto i:S)
       {
           if(mp[i]==1)
           {
               return i;
           }
       }
       
       
       return '$';
        }
       
    }

};
