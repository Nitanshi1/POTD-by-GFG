Given a number and its reverse. Find that number raised to the power of its own reverse.
Note: As answers can be very large, print the result modulo 109 + 7.

//Example 1:

//Input:
N = 2, R = 2
//Output: 4
Explanation: The reverse of 2 is 2 and after raising power of 2 by 2 we get 4 which gives remainder as 4 when divided by 1000000007.
SOLUTION:-

class Solution{
    public:
      long long m=1e9+7;
    long long power(int N,int R)
    {
       //Your code here
          long long res=1;
        while(R>0)
        {
            if((R&1)>0)
                res=((res%m)*(N%m))%m;
            N=((N%m)*(N%m))%m;
            R=R>>1;
        }
        return res;
        
    }

};
